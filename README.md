# Gene-Paralogs-Extracting-Categorizing-Project
Extract and categorize 13000+  genes and 50000+ paralogs
Folowing are the steps of this projects:
First, the True/False gene expression file was generated. It shows for each gene and its paralogs where they expressed/not expressed in 26 different types of tissues. 
Second, the gene/paralog and associated tissues file was extracted, which contains the True/False tissue values for each of  the 13000+ gene and their paralogs.
Third, the first category was produced where we required the number of paralogs that are 100% identical in T/F with the original gene.
Forth,in contrast, the second group is where paralogs with the main genes are not similar in the number of T/F s.
Fifth, The second group is divided into two subgroups 1-2 and 2-2.
     2-1 includes the paralogs that have  different values of T/F with the main gene in tissues.
     2-2 includes the paralogs that have different values of T/F with the main gene in conditions but similar in tissues.
